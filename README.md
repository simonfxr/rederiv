# ReDeriv - Linear time DFA based regular expression matching

ReDeriv is based on the algorithm presented in __Regular-expression derivatives re-examined__ (see [[1]](#1)).

## TODO write about existing and planned features.

## Current status

This is still very much work in progress, at the moment is just a prototype with
a lot of planned features missing (and most certainly a lot of bugs).
